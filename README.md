Project Flow
1.Users input a topic and specify the desired length of the blog post through the Streamlit UI.
2.The input topic and length are sent to the Gemini 1.5 Flash language model, which is integrated into the backend.
3.Gemini 1.5 Flash processes the input and generates a blog post based on the user's specifications.
4.The model autonomously creates a well-structured, engaging blog post tailored to the specified topic and word count.
5.The generated blog post is sent back to the frontend for display on the Streamlit app.
6.Users can customize the blog post further if desired and export or copy the content for their use.
7.To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities listed below,
8.Initialize Gemini 1.5 Flash:
9.Generate Gemini 1.5 Flash  API
10.Initialize the pre-trained model
11.Interfacing with Pre-trained Model
12.Blog Generation
13.Model Deployment
14.Deploy the application using Streamlit
